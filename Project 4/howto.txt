1. Code

2. Go to compiler and enter "g++ main.cpp type.cpp flightMap.cpp -o main"

3. If it works, then enter "./main" and you'll be given the output
    If it doesn't work, you'll be given errors (segmentation, undefined referenced) and it'll be your job to figure out how to solve those errors

4. Finally, we will create the makefile (or if Makefile already exists, we will just open that makefile)
    1) vim Makefile
    2) j, moves up
    3) k moves down
    4) l moves right
    5) h moves left
    6)go into insert mode (i)
        When in insert mode, use the arrows to go through the file
    7) insert tabs where needed
    8) click esc to exit insert mode
    9) shift + ;  then wq + enter (:wq)
	10) Enter "make"
	11) Enter "./main"
	12) Enter "make clean"
		If it shows rm etc., you are all set to submit!
